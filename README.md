### NOTES

- The Solution mainly focuses on the React implementation rather than focusing on UI.

- Used `@material-ui/core` library for implementing the UI.

- this is a `create-react-app` app for focusing on the implementation rather than implementing the whole build pipeline.

### STEPS TO RUN

- from the root directory of the project, run `npm install`.

- run `npm start`.
